7-23-17 -- new edition does not have exercises. Instead, I am refactoring what I believe to
be dirty code. This allows me to improve my style and better understand the unclear examples
used in the book.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finished with exercises for now. They are not too meaningful to me because they sometimes
come across as arbitrary. I don't feel like I'm making the connection between the concept
and how it is useful. This is how I understand it now and reserve the right to change my
mind at any future time :)

The value I see now for this book is as a reference for deep understandings of the language.
